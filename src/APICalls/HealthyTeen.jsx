For girls, puberty typically begins between the ages of 9 and 14, although this can vary from person to person. It is triggered by the release of hormones from the brain, specifically the pituitary gland, which sends signals to the ovaries to start producing estrogen. This hormone is responsible for most of the changes that happen during puberty.",

Physical changes are the most noticeable, and they happen gradually over several years. One of the first signs of puberty is the development of breast buds. These are small, tender lumps that appear under the nipples. Over time, the breasts will continue to grow and develop. It's completely normal for one breast to grow faster than the other in the beginning, and this typically evens out later on. ",
